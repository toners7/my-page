  <h2>What is Nascar</h2>
      <br>
        <p>
          The National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR) is an
          American family-owned and operated business venture that sanctions
          and governs multiple auto-racing sports events. Bill France Sr.
          founded the company in 1948 and his grandson Brian France became
          its CEO in 2003. NASCAR is motorsport's preeminent stock-car
          racing organization. The three largest racing-series sanctioned by
           this company are the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series, the
           Xfinity Series, and the Camping World Truck Series.
           The company also oversees NASCAR Local Racing, the Whelen Modified Tour,
           the Whelen All-American Series, and the NASCAR iRacing.com Series.
           NASCAR sanctions over 1,500 races at over 100 tracks in 39 of the 50 US states
           as well as in Canada. NASCAR has presented exhibition races at the

       <h3> Why I like Nascar </h3>
        <br>
           <p>
             I have always like racing. Especially when I was younger and used to
             race big wheels and bicycles down the street with some neighborhood
             friends of mine at the time. Then I was introduced to car racing from
             my father on the television. I was hooked from there. Nascar was
             exciting for me especially when drivers like
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1b2OYvja_Q"> Richard Petty</a>
             and Cale Yarborugh would race. I have never lost that love for racing.
              I do not race however I like to watch it.

        <h4>My Favorite Driver</h4>
        <br>
         <p>
           When growing up I liked watching <a href="images/rusty-wallace.jpeg">
              Rusty Wallace</a>. For a few reasons is why I liked him. For example
              he came from my hometown of <a href="images/arnold.jpg"> Arnold Mo.
              </a> I also really liked him cause he raced hard and he did not backdown
              from anyone. That is why he is one of my favorite racers. Here is his
              final win in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XC6PZ6ixGk"> Martinsville.</a>
